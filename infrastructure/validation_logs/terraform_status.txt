TERRAFORM VALIDATION STATUS
============================

Init: SUCCESS (with stub modules)
Validate: PARTIAL (module interface issues detected)

Issues Found:
1. Module interfaces need adjustment - some modules expect different parameters
2. Cross-variable validations removed for Terraform compatibility  
3. EKS, KMS, Redis, Load Balancer, Monitoring, Backup modules are stubs

Recommendations:
- Review each module's variables.tf and align with main.tf calls
- Implement stub modules fully before production use
- Add backend configuration for remote state management

For local development:
- Backend is configured as "local"
- Run: terraform init && terraform validate
- Use terraform.tfvars.example as template
